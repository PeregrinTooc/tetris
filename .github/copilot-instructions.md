We always write JavaScript with double quotes and tabs for indentation, so when your responses include JavaScript code, follow those conventions.

Functions shall exceed 10 lines only if absolutely necessary. If a function exceeds 10 lines, it should be split into smaller functions, unless it reduces the clarity of the code.
Don't write comments in the code, but use descriptive variable and function names to make the code self-explanatory.

When writing functions, ensure they are reusable and modular. Avoid hardcoding values; instead, use parameters to pass in data when necessary.
